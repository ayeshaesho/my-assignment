                                The first thing to ask yourself is why you got into business in the first place. Doing this will help you clarify your business goals, which will later on help you clarify your website's goals. Whether it's you alone or a team of co-stakeholders, hashing out the basic purpose of your business can help you narrow down the same thing for your website.
